CRAPS GAME

Craps is a dice game in which the players make wagers on the outcome of the roll, or a series of rolls, of a pair of dice. 
This is a simulation of that game. The rules are so follows:

Roll two dice. Each die has six faces representing values 1, 2, â€¦, and 6, respectively.
Check the sum of the two dice. If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 (called craps), you
lose; if the sum is 7 or 11 (called natural), you win; if the sum is another value
(i.e., 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10), a point is established. Continue to roll the dice until either
a 7 or the same point value is rolled. If 7 is rolled, you lose. Otherwise, you win.
This program acts as a single player.

This was a project for my JAV444 class at Seneca College.
